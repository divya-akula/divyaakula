Iâ€™m **Divya Akula** â€” a Microsoft MVP in Responsible AI and Azure AI Services, and a Microsoft Advanced Content Management Advocate.  

I currently work as a **Senior Technical Consultant â€“ AI & Microsoft Copilot Solutions at Sulava MEA**, where I help organizations adopt AI responsibly and build copilots, pro-code agents, and smart document solutions.  

This blog is where I share the projects I tinker with in my spare time part playground, part learning journal. Sometimes itâ€™s about sharpening my programming skills, sometimes experimenting with **OpenAI, Copilot Studio, and Microsoft cloud technologies**, and often exploring how to design **enterprise-grade, production-ready applications** that scale with reliability and observability in mind.
